This is the repository for the Minor Project that I undertook in the 6th Semester of my college .
The Project's foundation is built on concepts involving Machine Learning Algorithms and Real Time Session monitoring
based on manually curated dataset by taking into consideration ceratin viable parameters and target variable that would initially help in 
raising an alert and sending to the emergency contacts of the user. This is basically a research and development project that I worked upon 
along with my team. The machine Learning Algorithm that we used was Random Forest Classifier . We generalized the code using Python and its useful libraries 
which in turn helped significantly in proceeding with the project.
